# Password Generator

This is the solution to the password generator project.


## Instructions

The program will ask:
```
How many letters would you like in your password?
```
```
How many symbols would you like?
```
```
How many numbers would you like?
```
The objective is to take the inputs from the user to these questions and then generate a random password. Use your knowledge about Python lists and loops to complete the challenge. 

And every time you generate a password, the positions of the symbols, numbers, and letters are different.
